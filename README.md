# Module 15 Challenge - Leaflet Challenge
The United States Geological Survey(USGS), is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.

This is an interative dashboard to explore the [USGS All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) dataset. This dashboard contains a map to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations and hopefully secure more funding on issues facing our planet.

## Prerequistes
1. VSCode
2. Any Browser example: Google Chrome, Firefox etc


## Instructions
The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

   - Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

   - Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data 

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. First task is to visualize an earthquake dataset and complete the following steps:
   - Get the dataset by going to the link [USGS All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) dataset.
2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
   - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
   - The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
3. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
4. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
